These IDL routines performs a Runga Kutta integration of a system of equations
to advance the vector y(x)=[y0(x), y1(x), y2(x),...], where the yi[x] are the
individual solutions that are sampled at various times x. The inputs
are x (which is a 1D vector where the yi(x) are to be sampled), the boundary conditions
y0 (which is a 1D vector containing the initial yi(x[0]) values), the allowed
fractional error, the suggested initial timestep dx_try, the minimum timestep dx_min,
pro_name=string that provides the name of the proceedure that calculates the 
derivative dyi/dx (a 1D vector), and the 2D output array y[j,k], where j
indicates the quantity yj which is evaluated at x[k]. Additional parameters
are passed on to pro_name via the params structure. Set optional
quiet=1 to avoid printing the code's %progress. These procedures are adapted from 
Numerical Recipes in C, second edition, by Press et al (1992).

The file odeint.pro contains the IDL procedures odeint, rkqs, and rkck, 
which are called by int_sys_eqns.pro.

odeint_derivs.pro is the user-supplied IDL procedure that calculates 
the derivatives dy/dx.

int_sys_eqns.pro calls the above procedures to obtain a Runga Kutta integration that
advances the vector  y(x)=[y0(x), y1(x), y2(x),...] to the user-specified distances
(or times) x=[x0, x1, x2, ...].

test_int_sys_eqns.pro demonstrates how int_sys_eqns.pro is used.
